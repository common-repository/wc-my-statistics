== Description ==
My Statistics for WooCommerce plugin is a woocommerce addon, it enables customers to see their Woocommerce order statistics on their my-account tab. The customers can see the total numbers of orders by order status, the amount they have spent on the store, the count of products they have purchased.

This is a very basic version of the plugin. We intend to improve it and add more features based upon user feedback.

**Note: If the plugin's tab show 'page not found' error than you might need to refresh the site permalinks. You can do it by going to 'Settings/Permalinks' and clicking on 'Save Changes'.**
